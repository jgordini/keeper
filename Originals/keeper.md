UAB campus faculty, staff and students have a safe and free way to save passwords — not only their BlazerID passwords, but passwords that may be used in other platforms.

“Password security is necessary,” said Rob Ferrill, chief information security officer. “Your password is the key that allows access to any information.”

Before the pandemic UAB implemented two-factor authorization to keep student and faculty accounts safe. The Keeper password tool is another way to keep your passwords safe. 

Keeper is a campus-wide service for students, faculty, and staff that protects any passwords being used. This service requires only one strong password that will protect a number of others. 

Anyone with a BlazerID can access this service by visiting UAB IT website and searching [Keeper.](https://uabprod.service-now.com/service_portal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=b06bce9337109b0024a67c1643990ee6)

Setting up an account is easy. Follow the step-by-step instructions prompted on the screen. Download the necessary plugin for the desktop, and also download the Keeper app for iOS and Android devices.
